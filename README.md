# README

A school project to create an app with a given design. The design is an investor app, created to let creative people pitch their ideas to investors.

For the assignment, we will focus on a small flow in the design. The chosen flow is to allow an investor to explore the ideas of users on the app, and book a meeting with a chosen user. As this is a school assignment and time is a bit short, most functionality for a full implementation has been cut. It would however be fun to work on this further in the future as the concept is interesting.

## Features in the assignment:
* Showcase how an investor could explore user profiles/cv from a list of users.
* Showcase mini pitch from selected user profile
* Showcase how an investor could book a meeting with a user
* Showcase meeting functionality
